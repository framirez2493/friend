#Friend Finder Application
#Description
#Friend Finder implements friend matching based on the user's #responses to a ten question survey. The user responds to #questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly #Agree). When the survey is submitted, an existing user record #closest to the current user's responses is found and returned. #The closest set of user responses is defined as the set with the #lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined.

#Friend Finder application is meant to simulate a simple dating #app. The application is implemented using a Node.js and Express #server on the back end and the Materialize CSS framework on the #front end.
